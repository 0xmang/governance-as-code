# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Mapping

## Important note

This mapping is **illustrative** and intended for portfolio/demo purposes.
It shows how the implemented cloud controls support governance objectives commonly associated with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and Annex A themes.

It does **not** mean this environment is certified or fully compliant.

## Control mapping table

| Project component | Governance objective | ISO 27001-aligned theme | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terraform-managed baseline | Standardized, repeatable control deployment | Change management, secure configuration, documented operations | Infrastructure changes are codified and repeatable rather than ad hoc. |
| AWS Config | Ongoing configuration assessment | Monitoring activities, technical vulnerability/configuration oversight | Detects when selected resources drift from expected configuration states. |
| AWS CloudTrail | Auditability and accountability | Logging and monitoring | Captures API activity for traceability and investigation support. |
| AWS Security Hub | Consolidated security posture visibility | Security monitoring and event management | Aggregates findings to support governance oversight. |
| S3 encryption and public access blocking | Information protection | Access control, data protection | Helps reduce accidental exposure of governance data. |
| Azure Policy definitions and assignments | Preventive/detective control enforcement | Secure configuration, governance rules | Codifies expected resource behavior and checks compliance at scope. |
| Azure Log Analytics Workspace | Operational visibility | Logging and monitoring | Stores diagnostic and operational signals. |
| Resource tagging | Ownership and asset structure | Asset management | Helps identify ownership, environment, and governance context. |
| Naming conventions | Standardization | Operational control and consistency | Improves manageability, traceability, and reviewability. |
